## Types of changes accepted
This is intended to be focused on the Arduino library for the Argent Data Systems Weather Sensor Assembly p/n 80422. If you'd like to contribute code to extend functionality or address defects please do.  If you want to extend to another board type, I'm open to discussion.

Please try to mimic the style and follow Arduino best practices. Make sure you've tested it yourself. We do not have a unittest framework.

Maintainers will also test before merging.
