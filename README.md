Arduino library to interface with the Argent Data Systems weather station sensor assembly. This is the weather sensor assembly sold by SparkFun at https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8942 This library provides and API so that the weather information wind direction, wind speed, maximum wind speed and rainfall ammount can be read simply from functions.

Includes examples that interfaces with the SwitchDoc RJ11->Grove adapter here:  https://shop.switchdoc.com/products/weatherrack-interface-board-for-grove-pin-headers-rj11

Examples and code supports:
- Weather Sensor Assembly p/n 80422, 
- SwitchDoc Labs RJ11 WXLinkWR - Grove adapter (RJ11 -> Grove)
- Grove to Grove and Grove to male pin adapters
- Seeed Grove Shield and an Arduino Uno Rev3
