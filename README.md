# ADSWeather
Arduino library to interface with the Argent Data Systems weather station sensor assembly. This is the weather sensor assembly sold by SparkFun at https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8942 This library provides and API so that the weather information wind direction, wind speed, maximum wind speed and rainfall ammount can be read simply from functions.

Forked on 11/28/2021
Extending this library to extend the interface and support more features.
I'm currently working with Weather Sensor Assembly p/n 80422, RJ11 WXLinkWR - Grove adapter (RJ11 -> Grove), a Seeed Grove Shield and an Arduino Uno Rev3.
